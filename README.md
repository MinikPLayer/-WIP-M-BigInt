# M-BigInt
Trying to write my own BigInt implementation in C++

Simple C++ class named BigInt which is an integrer with infinite maximum value.

Files included:
- BigInt.hpp & BigInt.cpp - class declaration
- main.cpp - Example usage

Usage:
Just add #include "BigInt.hpp" / #include <BigInt.hpp> and declare a new object of BigInt class. 
Usage is the same as int. ( +, +
-=, <<, etc )
